# SENG-533
Pseudo-code representation of data collection file for SENG 533 Group 45

The reason for having pseudocode instead of providing the full code is because we worked with our capstone project for writing this report and for data collection. This included working with propreitary code that cannot be shared in full. As such, we have shown the logic added to the project for data collection in the pseudocode seen in this repository. This should show a clear representation of how we took our measurements using our client code. After printing data using the adjusted, we copied the data into a local text file for data collection. This data can also be seen in the repository.
